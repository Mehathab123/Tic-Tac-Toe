This is a simple web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
It allows two players to take turns placing their respective marks "X" and "O" on a 3x3 grid. 
The objective is to align three symbols in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, to win the game. 
The game automatically detects the winner and displays a message once a player wins. 
If all cells are filled without a winner, a draw message is shown. 
Players can reset the game at any time using the "Reset Game" or "New Game" buttons.
